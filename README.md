# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
### Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Airbnb listings to gain insights into the factors affecting rental prices and customer satisfaction.
**Tasks**

Import and clean the dataset: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data transformations.

Conduct descriptive statistics analysis: Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for numerical variables

Visualize the data: Create appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, bar charts) to analyze the distribution of numerical variables and the relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

Analyze geographical data: Create a heatmap to visualize the density of listings across New York City neighborhoods. Identify areas with the highest concentration of Airbnb listings.

Investigate the relationship between room type, neighborhood group, and price. Perform appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to determine if there are significant differences in rental prices based on room type and neighborhood group.

Analyze the relationship between customer satisfaction (as measured by the number of reviews and reviews_per_month) and factors such as price, room type, and neighborhood group.

Based on your findings, provide recommendations to Airbnb hosts on how to improve customer satisfaction and increase rental prices. Consider potential strategies such as offering different room types, targeting specific neighborhoods, or adjusting pricing based on demand and competition.
