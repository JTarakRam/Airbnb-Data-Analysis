# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Airbnb dataset for New York City. The goal is to gain insights into the factors affecting rental prices and customer satisfaction, and to provide recommendations to Airbnb hosts on how to improve customer satisfaction and increase rental prices.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this analysis is the "New York City Airbnb Open Data" available on Kaggle. It contains data on over 48,000 Airbnb listings in New York City, including information such as host ID, neighborhood, room type, price, availability, number of reviews, and customer ratings.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:
data directory contains the raw data file AB_NYC_2019.csv
notebooks directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, EDA, and analysis
figures directory contains the visualizations generated during the analysis
README.md file provides an overview of the project
**Getting Started**
To run the code in this project, you will need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle, or in github repo

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
airbnb.ipynb contains the code for cleaning the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing necessary data transformations. The notebook 02_EDA.ipynb contains the code for descriptive statistics analysis, data visualization, and analysis of the relationship between customer satisfaction and factors such as price, room type, and neighborhood group.
